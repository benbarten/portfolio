As one of the first 4 engineers on the team, I built the major parts of the backend and data architecture for the Semrush Enterprise Solutions product. Besides designing the system, I mentored junior developers, led the backend chapter and eventually became a <b>tech lead</b> for the data management team.
Our product went from <b>0 to Xm</b> ARR within 1.5 years.
