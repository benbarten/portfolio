An API platform which introduced a shift to an <b>API-first</b> development within [fino](https://fino.group). I implemented an API gateway and a developer portal together with my team to open up new revenue streams for the company. In this process, my team <b>drove best practices</b> in building an designing APIs across teams in the entire company.
